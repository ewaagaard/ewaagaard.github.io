Developed machine learning and optimization frameworks for accelerator control:

- **Surrogate Models**: Neural networks for kicker magnet delay prediction
- **Reinforcement Learning**: RL agents for optimizing injection system parameters
- **Injector Chain Modeling**: Numerical optimization of ion beam intensities
