I am a PhD candidate in accelerator physics at CERN, specializing in computational modeling of complex beam dynamics systems. My research combines numerical optimization, machine learning, and experimental benchmarking to advance particle accelerator performance.

My work focuses on developing Python simulation toolkits and optimization frameworks for:
- Beam dynamics and resonance analysis in particle accelerators
- Particle-matter interaction modeling for ion beams
- Machine learning applications for accelerator control systems

I am a contributor to [Xsuite](https://xsuite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), CERN's beam dynamics simulation toolkit, and develop open-source scientific computing packages for the accelerator physics community.

Currently, I'm developing Python simulation toolkits for modeling electromagnetic beam dynamics and magnet imperfections at CERN. I work extensively with experimental diagnostic tools like wire scanners and tomoscopes to analyze data from ion beams and validate simulation models.

My recent work includes:
- Developing semi-empirical numerical prediction models for the ALICE3 detector upgrade
- Building optimization toolkits that reduced injection oscillations by up to 70% in the Super Proton Synchrotron
- Implementing reinforcement learning agents for magnet system control

I'm passionate about applying computational techniques to solve complex physics problems and advance our understanding of particle accelerators.
