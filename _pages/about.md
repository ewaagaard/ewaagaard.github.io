I am a PhD candidate in accelerator physics at CERN. My research revolves around beam dynamics, numerical optimization, machine learning, and experimental benchmarking. Much of my numerical simulation work is based on [Xsuite](https://xsuite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), CERN's open-source beam dynamics simulation toolkit, where I contribute to several modules to model beam distributions.

My recent work includes:
- Developing semi-empirical numerical prediction models for future ion species in the CERN accelerator complex
- Building optimization toolkits to reduce injection oscillations in the Super Proton Synchrotron, by up to 70%
- Implementing reinforcement learning agents for magnet system control
